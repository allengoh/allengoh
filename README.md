##  Skills:

<b>Continuous Learning</b>

I believe in lifelong learning and continuously upskilling yourself. During my professional career as a pharmacist, I would read constantly to update myself on the new medications coming on the market so I have the knowledge to counsel patients and check for appropriateneess when doctors do prescribe them. Apart from tech, I am also interested in finance. In 2019, I enrolled myself onto the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) course to gain more knowledge in the field of finance and I have passed level 2 in 2022. During my time at Makers, I would use my spare time to read the best practices and industry standards on Javascript and Ruby as much as I can so I can produce a higher quality of well tested code.

<br>

<b>Time Management</b>

I believe good time management signals reliabilty and trustworthiness. As a pharmacist, having good time management allows me to stay on top of the workload and ensure medications are ready on the shelf to be collected by patients before they run out. During my time at Makers, we had group projects which we have to design and produce a functioning, good quality and well tested piece of software within a limited timescale. We had to break the workload down into manageble chunks and setting an estimated time to complete them. Working on those group projects have indubitably improved my time management skills.

<br>

<b>Good communicaton</b>

I believe in communicating well and I pride myself for it. As a pharmacist, having good communication is vital especially during interactions with patients. When I am giving advice or counselling patients on a medication usage, I will speak clearly and slowly while making appropriate eye contact to convey my message across more effectively while listening attentively to any concerns they may have and address them as they arise. I have to make sure my patients understand what I said as interpreting my advice incorrectly might cause negative effects to health. When I was at Makers, I find pair programming much more effective when me and my partner communicate clearly about our intentions on how to tackle the problem at hand before we start writing the code.
